        <p>Hi, my name is Jie Shen. Welcome to my personal website!</p>
    </section>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a highly motivated, detail-oriented 3rd-year student at the University 
            of Toronto, Mississauga campus pursuing an Honours Bachelor of Science in 
            Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. I am seeking an internship in data 
            science, software engineering or computer science.
        
            
            My interest in machine learning stems from its transformative potential to uncover 
            insights and drive intelligent decision-making across diverse fields. As a mathematics 
            and statistics student with a minor in computer science, I've developed a strong 
            foundation in analytical thinking, probability, and algorithmsâ€”key components of 
            machine learning. The ability to leverage vast data sets to solve complex, real-world 
            problems fascinates me, as it aligns with my passion for both quantitative analysis and 
            technology.
